Repository that contains a JavaScript project. 

The project consists of a car ensurance calculator. Users enter their details and the final value is updating at the same time.  Some fields change their options depending on the value chosen in another field.

The project has a timer that stops the program after finishing the time. Once users complete the form, a new page comes up with all the values entered by the user along wih the final value. The program uses session storage in order to pass the values from the form to the final page.
